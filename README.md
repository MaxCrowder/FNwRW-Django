Django - Flash News with River Waters

This repo contains source code for the Flash News podcast website using Django. The code is not production ready as the settings have not been configured for security. 

Flash News with River Waters is a financial news podcast made primarly as a skill for Amazon Alexa. The live website currently has problems with scaling. There is no solution for email signups, donations and mp3 data. To solve these problems, I recreated the website using Django. 





The current live website repo is available at https://github.com/MaxCrowder/Flash-News-with-River-Waters
The live website is currently being deployed by Netlify using the above repo.
